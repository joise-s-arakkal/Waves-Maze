# 🌊 Waves Maze — Echo Navigator

**Waves Maze** is an interactive memory maze game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Your goal is to navigate from start to goal — but here’s the twist: the maze walls disappear once you start moving.  
Touching a wall triggers a red “shockwave” and resets the maze. How far can you go?
